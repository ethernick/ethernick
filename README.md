### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

It's been a rought year. To support mental health Iâ€™m mowing to Mo. https://movember.com/m/ethernick. Please give and support.

Now that that's out of the way

#### At Work 

Currently I'm working with Peloton Technologies Inc, the fintech one. As UI/UX I fall mostly in HTML, CSS, JS worlds. Though I'll do a few lines here and there of C#. Other languages I've worked with are PHP ( of course ) & Python.

#### Other

When I'm not at work, I'm with family or in deep thought around media, communication theory, orality and it's impact on our insane world.
